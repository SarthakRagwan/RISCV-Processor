# RISCV-Processor
Verilog implementation of a 32-bit RV32I single-cycle RISC-V processor. The design follows a classical single-cycle datapath where instruction fetch, decode, execute, memory access, and write-back are completed within one clock cycle. The processor supports R-type, I-type, load/store (S-type), and branch (B-type) instructions.
